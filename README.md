# Hello, world.

#### Patchwork Ann Arbor - March 12, 2015 @ Nutshell

I'm Julie Cameron - a frontend developer for [Articulate](https://www.articulate.com/company/careers.php), working remotely in Ypsilanti. I get to play with Sass, modular CSS, Haml, CoffeeScript, Backbone, and Ruby On Rails all day long. It's horrible. _/sarcasm_

I'm a co-founder of the [Ann Arbor chapter of Girl Develop It](http://gdiannarbor.com), a nonprofit that exists to teach women how to code. It's a fantastically awesome community and you should check it out sometime - find your nearest chapter [here](https://www.girldevelopit.com/chapters)!

I'm also the original developer, maintainer, and support-provider of the open source plugins: [SlickQuiz](https://github.com/jewlofthelotus/SlickQuiz) (jQuery) and [SlickQuiz](https://github.com/jewlofthelotus/SlickQuiz-WordPress) [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/slickquiz/).
